1. *Single_Doubled_NN_Scratch* \
Contains implementations for **binary** classifiers Neural Networks:
- A single neuron neural network, with one hidden layer only
- A two hidden layered neural network with depth = 1 neuron per layer2.

2. *Multiclass_Single_DoubleLayered_NN_Scratch*
Contains implementations for binary and multiclass classifiers with classes and functions for different Network Architectures. These architectures are modifiable, yet three are shown:
- A Single fully connected layer architecture with 784 neurons for **binary** classification
- A Double fully connected layers architecture with 784 and 64 neurons for **binary** classification
- A Double fully connected layers architecture with 784 and 64 neurons for **multiclass** classification
