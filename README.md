Code Regarding projects for Deep Learning in Computer Vision can be found next

## 1. Optical Flow With RANSAC algorithm
Studying and measuring metrics to analyze the information content of video sequences. This is achieved through the analysis of Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Entropy graphs, which give information regarding the images sequences given consecutive frames. \
Coding optical flow estimation methods using global motion estimations and by visualizing the distribution of the energy of residual motion.
## 2. Implementing a Neural Network from Scratch
Implenting basic Neural Networks from Scratch for binary and multiclass classification with different depth and size of networks.
